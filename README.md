Background

The Vieux Carré (French Quarter) of New Orleans is a historic district renowned for its unique architecture and cultural significance. Advances in aerial surveying and photogrammetry have produced high-resolution orthomosaic imagery, 3D point clouds, textured models, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), Digital Surface Models (DSMs), and detailed accuracy reports. However, there is currently no cohesive, user-friendly web platform to host, visualize, and analyze these datasets collectively.

This design aims to create a React-based portal that delivers up-to-date spatial data products for a diverse audience—city planners, preservationists, researchers, and tourists—enabling layer toggling, temporal exploration, measurement tools, downloads, and reporting capabilities.
